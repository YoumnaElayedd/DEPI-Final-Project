HR Data Analysis Project
This project provides an in-depth analysis of HR data, leveraging Python, SQL, and Power BI to uncover insights related to employee performance, satisfaction, experience, and attrition. It includes interactive dashboards and SQL-driven insights, enabling HR managers to make informed decisions to enhance employee retention, optimize performance evaluations, and improve job satisfaction.

üìå Project Goals
Workforce Demographics and Diversity: Analyze workforce composition by gender, ethnicity, age, and business travel frequency to support diversity initiatives.
Improving Job Satisfaction: Assess satisfaction levels to identify and address areas with lower engagement.
Understanding Performance Trends: Explore discrepancies and trends in self and manager ratings.
Optimizing Training and Development: Evaluate the impact of training opportunities on top performers.
Enhancing Employee Retention: Pinpoint factors influencing attrition to develop targeted strategies.
üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
Python:

Data preprocessing and cleaning.
Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy.
Key actions:
Handled missing values and formatted columns.
Calculated metrics like attrition year and filtered out-of-range performance reviews.
Merged datasets and standardized data types.
SQL:

Data storage and advanced analysis.
Key actions:
Connected Python to SQL Server using SQLAlchemy.
Uploaded preprocessed data and ran SQL queries for insights on salaries, performance, and satisfaction.
Power BI:

Interactive dashboards for visualization and analysis.
Key actions:
Designed dashboards for satisfaction, performance, attrition, and salary trends.
Created dynamic slicers and calculated measures for deep analysis.
